	You can enable error logging by setting a threshold over zero. The
| threshold determines what gets logged. Threshold options are:
|
|	0 = Disables logging, Error logging TURNED OFF
|	1 = Error Messages (including PHP errors)
|	2 = Debug Messages
|	3 = Informational Messages
|	4 = All Messages
|
| You can also pass an array with threshold levels to show individual error types
|
| 	array(2) = Debug Messages, without Error Messages
|
| For a live site you'll usually only enable Errors (1) to be logged otherwise
| your log files will fill up very fast.
